# NES Save Editor

This is based on the work of Github user jdratlif.  It started with me playing to translate it 
from C++ to C# as I was working to recover my childhood Zelda 2 save file and figure out where I'd left off.
Then I figured I'd take a look at the original Zelda and jdratlif had a project for that as well.

That turned into a misguided thought about making a single NES Save Editor, HAHA! Oh well, this only kinda works
but I prefer C# and had a blast learning my way around the file structures and figuring getting things working.
